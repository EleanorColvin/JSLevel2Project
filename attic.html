    <p>You climb up a crumbling staircase and enter the attic. It is almost pitch black and impossible to see - <em>almost 
        looks like the perfect place to hide something.</em> 
        When you turn on your flashlight, you see that the entire room is filled with 
        creepy dolls. You could have sworn you saw one move. You should probably leave soon ... or maybe not?
