    <p>For whatever reason, you think it is a good idea to enter the basement. Once you've climed down the stairs, you 
        notice that the room is full of spiderwebs. You turn to leave, but the door swings closed. Spiders are crawling 
        out of the walls and coming towards you, you try to fight them off but your efforts are in vain. Better luck next time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>You have succumbed to the spiders</p>
