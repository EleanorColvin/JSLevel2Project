    <p>Welcome to the haunted house. You have stumbled across
        this eerie mansion while exploring a forest with you friends
        and decided to explore. Your friends, who have always been smarter 
        than you, decided to hang back. When you enter, the door swings closed, 
        trapping you in the house. You look around and see a few rooms 
        you can enter:
